# GeometryPlotting

Manipulations with basic geometrical primitives, such as point, line, plane, sphere, triangle in 3D space: translation and rotation operations, distance calculation, intersections, orthogonal projections of one object into another, etc. The objects can be defined in global or in one of the local coordinate systems and converted form one coordinate system into another.

The library was build to be as simple and intuitive as posible. Users do not have to remember the reference coordinate system of each object. The objects store the coordinate system they are defined in and all transformations will be caried out implicitly when necessary.
