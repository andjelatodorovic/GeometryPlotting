# GeometryPlotting

Manipulations with basic geometrical primitives, such as point, line, plane, sphere, triangle in 3D space: translation and rotation operations, distance calculation, intersections, orthogonal projections of one object into another, etc. The objects can be defined in global or in one of the local coordinate systems and converted form one coordinate system into another.
